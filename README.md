# Year 3 Aerospace Anki Cards
Flashcards repository for 3rd-year BSC TU Delft Aerospace classes. These flashcards are meant to help solidify the learned content in your memory (specially helpful for Production), and are meant to be used only **after** all the content has been read/understood. All the material is taken from the Sammaries - credits to Sam van Elsloo. Hopefully this will help you pass your exams this year, and be sure to leave feedback on any mistakes/improvements for the cards.

## A note on review intervals and card order

Make sure to set the default options for the decks as follows:
- New cards/day = 500
- Order = Show new cards in random order
- Easy interval = 1 day
- Maximum interval = 1 day

This way, your cards won't get pushed forward in time like they normally would in spaced repetition. Since we are trying to cram in a short period of time, we want to review the cards as often as possible.

## On flagging and fixes

If you see a mistake and don't want to lose your flow, just press Ctrl+1 to flag a card and then you can see the red ones in the Browse tab (if you want to fix/report them in batches once you're done reviewing).

## On studying with tags
Just follow the instructions in the image (currently only FD has tags).
